# graphql-to-json
A Node.js module to generate a JSON representation of your GraphQL schema

## Why
If you are using [Facebook's Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/), you know (or will soon find out) that you need to provide a JSON version of your GraphQL schema to the [Babel Relay Plugin](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/guides-babel-plugin.html). This very simple module allows you to generate the JSON representation very easily. The module does what is described in [the related section of Relay's documentation](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/guides-babel-plugin.html#schema-json).

## Installation
If you want to use **graphql-to-json** as a CLI tool, install it *globally* with npm:
```bash
npm install -g graphql-to-json
```

If you want to use it as module, install it locally:
```bash
npm install --save graphql-to-json
```

## Usage
### As a module
```javascript
graphqlToJson({input: String, [output: String]}, [callback]);
```

#### Parameters
* `input` *String* : relative or absolute path to a node module which exports a [GraphQLSchema instance](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlschema)
* `output` *String* (optional) : relative or absolute path where you want to create the file containing the JSON version of your schema. If no filename is provided, the file is named `schema.json` by default. If no path is provided, the file is created where the command is executed
* `callback` *Function* (optional) : a function to execute when the output file is created.

#### Returns
* *Promise* : a [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) which is fulfilled when the output file is created.

### As a CLI tool
```bash
graphql-to-json INPUT [OUTPUT]
```
See above for more information about the parameters.

*NB* : the CLI just calls the function exported by the module.

## Examples
### As a module, with no callback
```javascript
// index.js
// the file that creates your GraphQLSchema is located at ./data/schema.js
const graphqlToJson = require('graphql-to-json');
graphqlToJson({input: './data/schema.js', output: './data/schema.json'});
```
### As a module, with a callback
```javascript
const graphqlToJson = require('graphql-to-json');
graphqlToJson({input: './data/schema.js', output: './data/schema.json'}, () => alert('Done !'));
```
### As a module, with a promise
```javascript
const graphqlToJson = require('graphql-to-json');
graphqlToJson({
  input: './data/schema.js',
  output: './data/schema.json'
}).then(() => alert('Done !'));
```
### As a CLI tool
```
$ graphql-to-json ./data/schema.js ./data/schema.json
```
